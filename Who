This is the 
Datajus Open Law, Public consolidate legal repository for data science research -  


The goal... Provide a central consolidated repository for the laws of the U.S. to enable data scientist to perform machine learning and other "big data" technologies.  We are seeking bit coins for initial storage and host fees for a year of service.

The analysis of our laws is an understanding of us. The Internet is filled with well structured legal resources from paid services, free sites that  collect links to government site, and even sites that store and structure those laws for easy access. These free resources are mainly dispersed across many servers.  Data scientist will benefit, with  all this information stored in a single, specialized repository  (NOSQL database  in hadoop) where such research as predictive analysis can be performed.
Imagine, given a fact pattern and jurisdiction a  program can output a probabilistic analysis of the outcome. And it's all open source. The vision is that the advancements in the fields of â€œbig-dataâ€ analytic machine learning and predictive analysis can be applied to this data to allow us to further understand and appreciate the laws of this county.  We need your support to acquire the initial storage to enable data scientist do wha
