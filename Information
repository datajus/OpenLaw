What informationt will the repository store? 
how it is organized? and,
how do you access the data?



What will be stored:

The repository will store the law "related" data of the United States including.

* i Law - the written laws of each state and federal governmemt.

* Case Law -  The court decisions of each state's highest court and the US supreme court and 
federal appellate districts.

* Secondary-
  1. Briefs: Legal arguments and briefs that are openly available in electronic format and in the public domain.
  2. Legal dictionaries and references that are in the public doamin
  

How is it stored.

Each case law (court decision) and secondary reference will be stored as a single document or file.

Each jurisdiction's codified law will be divided and stored by what is commonly refered to as "title".  
This divides those laws
into 100-300 seperate documents each containing a set of related laws.
Each title will be its own document or file.

Some jursidictions do not break up their laws into titles.  These will be handled case-by-case.  

General policy is to break the 
statues up into a) related groups b) that are large enough to take advantage of hadoop storage.
